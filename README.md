<h1>Student Registration System using Python </h1>
<p>In this project, I created a fully functional Student Registration System. I created a GUI using Tkinter. It allows users to enter all necessary details, including a profile picture and other information. Additionally, there is a search function that enables users to search for any student using their registration number.
And When you save a student's details, all the information is pushed into an Excel file, allowing you to register as many students as you want. I also developed a search function that retrieves and displays student details from the Excel file.
